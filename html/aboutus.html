Meantime, I had worked as dental assistant and learned about dealing with people with different personality and learned how to convey my message effectively. I always had an aspiration in tech industry and I was always told that I am tech savy. I enjoy problem solving and challenging problem and solving them brings me sense of accomplishment. Therefore, I am hoping to challenge myself in tech industry and hopefully be a problem solver for your organization.</p>
